## Data Sourcing
The dataset was gotten from https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmum9lxqnoa6hr97wpgb5h0m00zll/9qhzhdup3qzxmztz/aHR0cHM6Ly9vbnl4ZGF0YS5jby51ay9kYXRhLWRuYS1kYXRhc2V0LWNoYWxsZW5nZS8=

## Data Transformation
Data was loaded into power query to remove nulls, duplicates, and some data type were changed though the data was much cleaner than I thought.

## Modelling
No modelling was done for these datasets because it contains only one table with 16 columns.

## Visualization
Some of the business questions were put into visuals using pie, bar, and line chart. Using those visuals, we check for the following:

## Recommendation
Businesses should think of making more packages for commercials cars owners. The prices of insurance should be reviewed according to the type of coverage zone because household income varies and also the datasets of the previous years will be required for comparison and data-driven decision making
